    <h2><center>The rise of Tobbaco smoking</center></h2>
    <p>
        Smoking is one of the most highly addictive forms of recreational drug use which is being practised by over one
        billion people globally. Tobacco was largely practised by people especially young adults when it was first
        invented but over the years, the perception surround smoking as changed. This could be attributed to the fact
        that the adverse effect of this act became more prominent. Consequently, this act came to be viewed in a
        decidedly negative light, especially in western countries. Its rise has become much more observable in
        recent years.

    <!-- Impact of Tobbaco  -->
  <div class="w3-third w3-justify">
      <h2><center>Impact of Tobbaco</center></h2>
      <p>
          Tobacco smoking is a major cause of one of the world's largest health problems. Throughout the 20th century,
          this tobacco smoking killed around 100 million people. The stats reveals that most of these people are in rich countries.
          This act claims the life of approximately 8 million people each year. After extensive research, scientists
          have suggested that tobacco smoking could claim up to one billion people over the 21st century. It is also
          responsible for some respiratory diseases like lung cancer and could cause an increase blood pressure
          and heart rate.

    <h2><center>Visualisation</center></h2>
    <p>
        The following visualisations seeks to explore the effect Tobacco smoking has on the life expectancy of a country.
        It contains a map of the life expectancy, cigarette consumption and death rate of people around the world.
        I then move on to compare the lowest and highest cigarette consumption rate of people around the world with
        the least and highest death rate caused by Tobacco smoking. This was achieved using histograms .
        Finally, I uses a scatter plot to help view the relationship between Cigarette consumption and life Expectancy.

          <h2>Death by Tobacco</h2>
          <p>We must consider the fact that the population of the country can largely impact the cigarette consumption rate. This begs the question on whether western countries and countries with large population in Asia would have the most deaths caused by cigarette smoking.</p>
          <p>&ensp;</p>
          <p>&ensp;</p>
          <p>Based on the map to the right, this seems to be the case. However, some outliers are worth taking note of; Countries like Central African Republic and Zimbabwe which have a relatively low cigarette consumption seem to have more deaths.
          It would be a fair assumption to make if one states that this observation might be the result of a lack of advanced medical services to prevent the fatality of Tobacco consumption.</p>

        <p>
            Cigarette consumption has become steadily increasing over the year.
            The visualisations below show nine countries with the highest cigarette consumption rates
            and the lowest consumption rates.

          <p>
              The histogram on the right shows countries with the highest cigarette consumption rate. It can be seen that most
              of this countries are from Europe and Asia. Countries like China and India which have the largest population
              don't seem to be among the countries with the highest cigarette consumption. This reveals that the population of
              a country is not a strong determinant of the cigarette consumption rate.

              Most of the countries with the lowest cigarette consumption rates are African countries.Although India is the
              second most populous nation in the world, it has the 6th lowest cigarette consumption rate in the world.
              Just as seen in the cigarette consumption map, first world countries seem to consume more Cigarette than
              third and even second world countries.

            Tobacco smoking is one of the worlds largest health problems. Over the course of the 20th century.

                  The visualisation to the right shows the top nine countries with the highest cigarette consumption
                  It can be seen that none of this countries are part of the top nine countries with the highest cigarette
                  consumption. This shows that the cigarette consumption rate of a country doesnt have a great effect on
                  the numbers of death caused by cigarette consumption. This is because the quality of medical services
                  varies across countries

          <h2>Least Deaths by Tobacco</h2>
          <p>
              As we can see south sudan, Nigeria are countries with the least deaths by Tobacco. This might because they
              have relatively lower cigarette consumption rate . It can also be seen that most of the countries with the
              least deaths caused by Tobacco are African countries.
          </p>
          <p>
              If the cigarette consumption of a country truly affect the average life expectancy of people in that country,
              then countries with very high cigarette consumption should have a reduced life expectancy. This hypothesis will
              be explored in the visualisation below

              As we can see most of the countries in Europe occupy the top right of the visualisation
              This means they have a higher cigarette consumption and life expectancy.

            Although, Tobacco smoking is detrimental to the health and is one of the major causes of early death,
            there doesn't exist a strong positive correlation between the cigarette consumption per capital of a
            country and the life expectancy of people within that country.There are other factors that might have a stronger
            effect on the life expectancy of a country such as the standard of living and the Accessibility of grounded medical services.
